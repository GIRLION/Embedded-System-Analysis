Firmware Static Analyzer

The Firmware Static Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to perform static analysis on firmware binaries. It aims to provide insights into the structure and security posture of firmware by extracting and analyzing its contents. This tool is particularly useful for security researchers, developers, and anyone interested in understanding the inner workings of firmware.

Key Features:
 Binwalk Integration: Utilizes binwalk to extract and analyze firmware files, identifying embedded filesystems and components.Web Interface Analysis: Examines web directories within the firmware to identify potential vulnerabilities, such as outdated JavaScript files or insecure update mechanisms.
    Boot Process Examination: Analyzes boot directories to gather information about bootloaders and kernel images, providing insights into the boot sequence and potential security weaknesses.
    Configuration File Review: Inspects critical configuration files in the /etc directory, such as passwd, protocols, and services, to identify user accounts, network services, and system protocols.

Usage Instructions:
Prerequisites: Ensure that binwalk and dumpimage are installed on your system. These tools are essential for extracting and analyzing the firmware.Running the Tool: Execute the script by passing the firmware binary as an argument:

    python static_analyzer.py <binary_file>

Reviewing Results: The tool generates a comprehensive report detailing the findings, which can be used to assess the security and functionality of the firmware.

System Requirements:

    Python 3.x
    binwalk and dumpimage utilities



On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

    sudo apt update

Install Binwalk:

    sudo apt install binwalk

Install Additional Dependencies:
    binwalk may require additional tools for extracting certain types of files. You can install these with:

    sudo apt install squashfs-tools

    sudo apt install gzip bzip2 tar
